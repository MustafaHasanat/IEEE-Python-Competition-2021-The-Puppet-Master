 it's a GUI tool that can automate one of the most common daily work, "organizing files".
 It can take a copy of your files, sort and rename them then put them in a new folder. 
 This operation can be done in two parts (sort and rename), or you can do them both at once.  
 
it automates renaming and moving files from the disc. You can rename hundreds of files as a sequence of numbers by a single click. You can also move any number of scattered files
among the discs to a single folder and sort them by their extensions or names into many specific folders with a single click. (the tool will categorize the files based on the
initial letters of their names or their extensions, then create a folder for each category and move the associated files to it).
